#  FaceIt App

This App was created as part of the online and freely available Stanford CS193 IOS Application Developement course. 

This app populates the user's screen with a smiley face emoticon that can be manipualted in various ways to change it's size, color, and expression via manipulating the eyes (open, closed etc) and the mouth (smiling, frowning, in between etc.)

The application has also been extended to includea  Split View Controller. Now the user has two simultaneous views, an emotions view featuring a few default emotion buttons (Sad, Happy, Worried) and the default Face View Controller. Clicking an emotion button launches the face view with that specific emotion pre-rendered. Once launched, gestures work as normal to edit the face to the user's wish.
